**Apereo email from 20th Aug 2024 about OpenCollectives recommendations and Dat.Ecosystem's to-do's (in bold) to complete the fiscal sponsorshipt transfer**
1. Apereo would like a detailed transaction history of dat-ecosystem's revenue and expenses.
   * The dat-ecosystem team can download transaction reports from the OpenCollective dashboard.
      * Go to the "Transactions" page (top right hand corner) and use the export csv feature.
2. Apereo would like to ensure dat-ecosystem has their contribution history and contributors'contact information.
   1. The dat-ecosystem team can download contribution reports from the OpenCollective dashboard.
      * Go to the "Contributors" page (top right hand corner) and use the export csv feature.
      * This output includes profiles of contributors and contact information (e.g., email).
   2. OpenCollective recommends dat-ecosystem update their OpenCollective profile with “We have moved” content to help direct future contributors to Apereo.
   3. OpenCollective recommends dat-ecosystem archive page their OpenCollective page. This will disable further transactions, but keep the records archived.
3. OpenCollective would like to confirm with the dat-ecosystem team that the project will not continue to use the OpenCollective platform.
   1. The platform is available at no cost to "independent" projects (Dat.Ecosystem would qualify for free use).
   2. The platform could be used only as a ledger and for managing workflows. All financial services can be turned off, e.g., collecting funds, transactions, billing, etc.
4. Details and a check list for migrating "collectives" can be found at: https://docs.opencollective.foundation/leaving-ocf
5. Apereo will need to send OpenCollective Foundation:
   1. Letter of transfer of fiscal sponsorship (a one-page letter confirming transfer of fiscal sponsorship that OC would sign). (Attached)
   2. OpenCollective Foundation requires from the new Fiscal Sponsor (to be included with the above transfer letter)
      1. MOU between dat-ecosystem and Apereo (Dat.Ecosystem team to review and sigh)
      2. Proof of Apereo's 501c3 status (Attached)
      3. Bank account transfer information




* [ ] create IRS determination letter for dat-ecosystem to submit to OpenCollective to complete transition of fiscal sponsorship change

## Code for Science and Society
1. [ ] compile a list of all dat related email addresses and domains and transfer them to Apereo generating `AuthIDs`


Domain Name: dat.foundation	iwantmyname.com
Domain Name: datproject.org	iwantmyname.com
Domain Name: datbase.org	iwantmyname.com
Domain Name: datprotocol.net	iwantmyname.com
Domain Name: datprotocol.org	iwantmyname.com
Domain Name: datprotocol.com	iwantmyname.com
Domain Name: dat-data.com	Squarespace

Here are the names that I believe are connected to dat simply based off the name itself:
Domain Name: dat.foundation  <<-- Email service provided by CS&S
Domain Name: datproject.org   <<-- Email service provided by CS&S
Domain Name: datbase.org
Domain Name: datprotocol.net
Domain Name: datprotocol.org
Domain Name: datprotocol.com
Domain Name: dat-data.com

I also want to mention that it appears there are a few groups created for datproject.org within CS&S's Google Workspace:
- accounting@datproject.org is an alias for CS&S's accounting@codeforsociety.org Google Group
- osaos@datproject.org is an alias for CS&S's osaos@codeforsociety.org Google Group
- community@datproject.org Google Group
- hi@datproject.org Google Group with an alias of hi@dat.foundation
- domains@datproject.org Google Group
- security@datproject.org Google Group


Further notes / questions:
The domain dat-data.com is held at squarespace. It returns a white screen for me on http://dat-data.com/ (and does not return over https).  Is that actually in use, and what's the plan for that domain? From what I might infer from the Web Archive, that domain may have existed for quite some time (since 2013) and was redirected to datproject.org at some point. (I'm making this assertion based on how the Web Archive behaves in later years, but that should be confirmed). Does that sound right? Here's what that site may have looked like in 2014: http://web.archive.org/web/20140729141359/http://dat-data.com/.
Both https://datproject.org/ and at https://dat.foundation/ have a message at the top of their sites directing users to https://dat-ecosystem.org/. Is dat-ecosystem.org controlled by anyone you know, and what's the story for that site and it's relationship to this domain sponsorship project?

The domains datprotocol.net and datprotocol.org both redirect to datprotocol.com.

The domain datbase.org does not appear to currently have a web presence, but I see that it was referenced in a 2017 article
(see https://blog.dat-ecosystem.org/new-website/), and it is present on the Internet Archive between 2017 and 2020, e.g. http://web.archive.org/web/20180917092617/http://datbase.org/. What's the story for this domain / website?
If it's useful to have a brief meeting to discuss any of this (phone or video rather than by email), let me know. :-)

Groups/Account Alias
community@datproject.org has received a total of 17 emails between 12/2017 and 11/2023, with the last email received on 11/1/2023.  Probably fair to say this group is not active.
osaos@datproject.org (alias to CS&S group) received about 15 emails back in 2018 and nothing since.  Also fair to say this is probably not active.
accounting@datproject.org (alias to CS&S user account) -  a search of this inbox does not result in any emails addressed to this address.  This address is also likely obsolete.
hi@datproject.org - This address was used back in 2020 and 2021 and includes some Let'sEncrypt notificaitons, Zoom notifications, and Twitter notifications.  However, the latest email was received on 10/23/2021 (excluding a few spam messages).
domains@datproject.org -  Appears to receive domain renewal notices here but generally looks spammy and unnecessary.
security@datproject.org -  A total of 4 emails from 9/2018 through 3/22, mostly related vulnerabilities in DAT's infrastructure.


USAGE INTENTION:
The following is what we ideally would want:
1. All email addresses would just permanently forward to hi@dat-ecosystem.org
2. We would be happy if all emails sent and received by any of the old email addresses could be copied or forwarded once to hi@dat-ecosystem.org
3. We want to cause as little work as possible. The main domain these days is https://dat-ecosystem.org and old pages are kept, because a lot of links exist that point to them and that is why we want to add the deprecation notice to all domains we haven't yet. We do have github repositories and github pages for all old dat related websites, but as you noticed, some of them are currently not active sadly (such as dat-data.com) and we plan to restore them showing the original website and the deprecation notice to forward to the dat-ecosystem.org website.
4. One domain missing from the list is `https://dat.land` and also `https://try-dat.com`, which have been used in the past, but I assume they expired. Too bad, but it is what it is i guess, but otherwise we'd be happy to re-activate them as well.


The https://dat-ecosystem.org domain is currently held on behalf of dat-ecosystem by the company behind the dat-ecosystem project "datdot".
We did set up a zoho email account, because zoho provides a free custom domain email account and we could not find any other provider who does that.
These days, dat-ecosystem consortium uses "discord app" to communicate and mirrors everything to an instance of the dat project "cabal chat" (a p2p chat system), so if discord ever has problems, we still have the cabal chat running with a copy of all messages and the ability to communicate through a dat powered p2p chat system.


One additional question we have is whether it would be a lot of effort to establish a mailing list.
In the past few years we have been using a service hosted by https://riseup.net/ to manage our mailing list, but the sad part is the mail address ends in riseup.net and we would definitely be happier if we could create something like `news@dat-ecosystem.org` or `mailinglist@dat-ecosystem.org`. If this causes additional inconvenience though we can keep it the way it is.

Hi,

I am very sorry, I somehow thought the ball is on your side and the next steps would be to trnasition domains and forwarding emaild and the likes. I got caught up with my work.

Alright, I can confirm that dat-ecosystem will not continue to use the OpenCollective Platform as you asked us.
Now, as you indicated, we would love to disable all financial services, such as:
* collectinf funds
* transactions
* billing
* etc...

But as you said, it could still be used as a ledger for managing workflows.
We would love to use that feature, so people can submit expenses and we can review
and then forward the expense/invoice to Apereo for payment if that is okay.
Please let me know.


APEREO:
1. cannot accept crypto donations
2. close other discal sponsorship relations

dat's fiscal sponsorship analysis would have to be migrated off of Github to our accounting services so we have unified books for our reporting requirements with the US Internal Revenue Service.



YES, dat ecosystem will be completely separated from Open Collective as a fiscal sponsor. The platform opencollective.com is very much like CiviCRM, etc...



Open Issues

Options for crypto-currency held by Code for Science and Society
Continued use of OpenCollective platform.
Integration of book-keeping and business processes with Apereo

Dat-Ecosystem questions

What fees does Apereo Foundation expect from its fiscally sponsored projects? (see Handbook above)
Can Dat-Ecosystem continue operating through Open Collective? (see above)
In case of future cryptocurrency donations, could Apereo Foundation support the process of claiming these funds?
What are the guidelines and rules of the process for terminating fiscal sponsorship agreements by either party?
