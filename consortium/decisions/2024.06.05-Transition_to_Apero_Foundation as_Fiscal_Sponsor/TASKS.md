## DONOR FOR DAT
Task: get back to fedor
- I guess it would help if you reach out to the potential donor. 

This is the conversation I saw apereo already answered on 6th of September once - Hope the process will be fast enough for the donor not to change their mind :-)

https://mastodon.gamedev.place/deck/@apereo@social.fossdle.org/113091890562451336


"[...]we have somebody who wants to donate to the dat-ecosystem and we need to tell them how[...]".

Phyllis can provide options. The snag now is simply we can't accept the contribution until your official (e.g., Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement in place). If it helps I am happy to reach out to the donor to give them an update so that they know what the hold up is and you do not lose them.

1. To update the open collective page with a note that dat-ecosystem has moved, we would need some kind of link to forward or redirect people to.
   * Will there be some sort of page where people can donate to dat-ecosystem?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## APEREO DAT PAGE

   * As mentioned earlier (I think I tagged Patrick a few times on mastodon already), we have somebody who wants to donate to the dat-ecosystem and we need to tell them how they can do that.
   * This information is important for anyone who comes to the dat-ecosystem open collective page and anyone we might want to inform through email.

MICHELLE HALL
The landing pages accessed via www.apereo.org (apereo.org/foo) all have the same look for branding and site continuity. If you go down to the bottom of each project page there are links to the projects' pages, e.g., github, a project home page, documentation, community contacts, etc.--whatever you like. We could put links to any dat.ecosystem resource(s) you like there. For example, the OpenCast project has an Apereo page (https://apereo.org/programs/software/opencast, https://apereo.org/opencast), then that page has links to their project home page (https://opencast.org/) code repository (https://github.com/opencast/opencast), as well as their documentation (https://docs.opencast.org/).
We'll set up the Apereo page and you provide the links. You provide all the content and we just manage the Apereo content. Michelle Hall is our Drupal admin who can set it up. Again, once you're official we'll launch it.
