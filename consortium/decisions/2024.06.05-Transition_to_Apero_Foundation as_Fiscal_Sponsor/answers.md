-------------------------------

## 1. Charitable purpose of the project:

Dat-Ecosystem's purpose is described in our manifesto:
https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/organization/blob/13eb30bb4270f3c1d10f2bf4e36f01f636c3e90f/MANIFESTO.md

## 2. Describe the project/organization's legal status:

We are a 501(c)(3) project, fiscally sponsored by the Open Collective Foundation through OpenCollective.com. As the Open Collective Foundation is winding down its operations, the Dat-Ecosystem project is now seeking a new 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor. Additionally, some of our intellectual property, specifically the domains and the Dat brand, are still held by our original fiscal host, the 501(c)(3) US-based public charity, Code for Science and Society.

## 3. Current leadership (individuals governing the project/organizatoin) and governance model:

The Dat-Ecosystem is governed by a consortium of individuals who are founders of long-standing Dat-based projects. This consortium oversees the brand and funds on behalf of the member projects and collaborates to foster progress toward the goals described in the manifesto.
https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/organization/blob/13eb30bb4270f3c1d10f2bf4e36f01f636c3e90f/MANIFESTO.md

## 4. Describe whether the project/organization is currently in or was previously in any other fiscal sponsorhsip arrangements and why the group is looking for a new fiscal sponsor.

The Dat-Ecosystem was initially founded in collaboration with Code for Science and Society. Code for Science and Society charged a fixed fee for its services. However, there were periods when this fee was unaffordable for the Dat projects, which largely rely on volunteer work and donations through Open Collective.

Fortunately, the Open Collective Foundation offered to take over fiscal sponsorship pro bono. However, due to technical and logistical reasons, they were unable to hold Dat-related assets, such as domains and the brand. As a result, Code for Science and Society agreed to retain these assets on behalf of Dat pro bono until a better solution could be found.

Recently, changes have led to the Open Collective Foundation deciding to wind down its operations. Consequently, we must find a new home for our fiscal sponsorship and asset management once again.

#### a. Has the group considered any other fiscal sponsors, i.e., other charitable organizations?

We conducted extensive research initially to identify potential candidates and received a list of potential organizations from Open Collective. Among these candidates was the Apero Foundation.

After carefully evaluating each potential fiscal sponsor, the Apero Foundation stood out significantly in terms of its mission and alignment with the goals of the Dat-Ecosystem.

## 5. What is the timeframe for joining the Apero Foundation as a fiscal sponsoree?

The Dat-Ecosystem is governed by a consortium, which must reach a unanimous decision on fundamental issues, a process that can take some time. The contract with the Open Collective Foundation expires on June 23, 2024. We were initially told we had until September 2024 to find a new fiscal sponsor, but their latest communication has informed us that their fiscal sponsorship will end sooner than expected.

## 6. What timeframe will the project/organization exist over, e.g., a set duration of time, periodically, open-ended, etc.?

The Dat-Ecosystem operates on an open-ended basis, with projects evolving over time. Several member projects have existed for many years and are expected to continue contributing to the maintenance of the peer-to-peer open-source software stack. While some projects are short-lived and eventually wind down, such cases are the exception rather than the norm.

## 7. Describe the resources and contractual obligations the applicant is brining into the sponsorship

Presently, the Dat-Ecosystem funds amount to $3,807.60 USD and are held through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/dat). The possibility exists for the transfer of the Dat brand and domains from Code for Science and Society. Additionally, an outstanding cryptocurrency donation is under the custody of our initial fiscal sponsor, Code for Science and Society, owing to the limitations of OpenCollective.com in managing crypto tokens.

Furthermore, there are a few subscribed sponsors through Open Collective whose continued support we value. Therefore, it would be advantageous if the Apero Foundation could extend fiscal sponsorship through Open Collective. However, if such an arrangement is not feasible, we express our interest in fiscal sponsorship from the Apero Foundation irrespective of the platform.

Currently, we have no other contractual obligations. Some minor expenses, such as a glitch.com hosting and the dat-ecosystem domain name are being held on behalf of dat-ecosystem by member projects. Periodically, funds received by the Dat-Ecosystem are allocated to reimburse these projects for the mentioned services.

#### a. Describe the current project/organizational personnel and their status as employees, volunteers, or independent contractors.

All personnell of Dat-Ecosystem are volunteers. Nobody is employed by Dat-Ecosystem. The personnel consists of consortium members only, each of which is also a (co-)founder of an independent Dat-Ecosystem member project. If the Dat-Ecosystem consortium decides to act in accordance with the manifesto, it usually assigns budgets to activities and selects people to carry out those activities and funds it via the budget it resides over.

#### b. Will the status of the current personnel change should the AF accept the project/organization’s application?

No, the consortium and its members and all Dat-Ecosystem member projects will stay unchanged.

## 8. (a-c) What assets will transfer to AF if the project/organization’s application is accepted? For each asset, the applicant should specify which will transfer in entirety to AF, which may be partially transferred to AF (and how divided), which, if any, are to be licensed to AF, and which, if any, may require some other arrangement.


The current balance from Open Collective would be transferred to AF. If we can stay on open collective, then also the current subscribed regular sponsors of Dat-Ecosystem (who were currently paused by Open Collective). Also funds from the crypto donation which are currently held by Code for Science and Society and that would be it for now. There are no contact lists or bank accounts or other assets.


#### d. What liabilities will transfer to AF if the project/organization’s application is accepted? For each liability, the applicant should specify which will transfer in entirety to AF, which may be partially transferred to AF (and how divided), which, if any, is to remain with another/previous fiscal sponsor, and which, if any, may require some other arrangement.

Dat-Ecosystem has no outstanding liabilities, so no liabilities would transfer.

## 9. How will the project/organization earn revenue?

#### a. Does the project/organization plan to earn income through sales or services, i.e., related or unrelated business activities, through fundraising activities, events, or ongoing partnerships?

The project primarily relies on donations from Open Collective Members and in very rare occasions cryptocurrency contributions as its sources of revenue.
While the consortium of volunteers may explore the possibility of applying for grants in the future, it's important to acknowledge that such endeavors require considerable time and entail uncertain outcomes.

In summary: We seek donations and sponsorships and pursue grants.


#### b. What types of activities generate regular expenses for the project/organization?

The Dat-Ecosystem does not engage in activities that incur regular expenses for the project or organization. However, we occasionally organize events such as conferences and sponsor technical writers to promote open-source contributions or assist in resolving issues shared by many Dat-Ecosystem member projects. These initiatives are pursued only when adequate funds are available to support them.

## 10. What infrastructure is used today, and does the project/organization hope tu use any AF's current infrastructure or reqiure new infrastructure?

We utilize open-source tooling and software at no cost, including GitHub organizations and repositories, free markdown documents, and we maintain a Discord server alongside a peer-to-peer Cabal chat instance. Our email services are provided by ProtonMail, and the Dat-Ecosystem domain is sponsored by one of our member projects. Additionally, we manage several social media profiles without incurring any expenses.

Notably, our operations do not necessitate any cloud or server instances apart from glitch.com which we use to bridge communication from our discord server to a peer to peer chat messenger called "cabal" which is also a Dat-Ecosystem member project.

## 11. Does the project/organization require insurance for any activities or personnel involving risk exposure?

No.

## 12. Does the group propose any political or lobbying activity, and if so, what?

The group does not propose any political or lobbying activity other than what is written in the manifesto and is considered mostly apolitical by the consortium members.

https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/organization/blob/13eb30bb4270f3c1d10f2bf4e36f01f636c3e90f/MANIFESTO.md

## 13. Is the applicant willing to adopt the Apero Welcoming Policy?

Yes.

## 14. Is the group willing to submit a quarterly report?

Yes.
