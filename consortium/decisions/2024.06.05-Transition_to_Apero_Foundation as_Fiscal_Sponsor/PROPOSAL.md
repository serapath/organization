# Proposal:

## `Transition to Apero Foundation as Fiscal Sponsor`

#### Date: 2024.06.05

#### Submitted By: [Alexander Praetorius](https://github.com/serapath)

## Background

The fiscal host, Open Collective Foundation, is undergoing dissolution,
rendering the Dat Ecosystem Account unable to receive contributions on https://opencollective.com.
It is imperative that we spend or transfer our remaining funds by the 30th of September 2024.
For more details regarding the dissolution of Open Collective Foundation,
please refer to the [official statement](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-collective-official-statement-ocf-dissolution/)

Extensive research into potential alternative 501(c)(3) Fiscal Sponsors has identified
the [Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/) as a candidate aligned with the Dat Ecosystem Manifesto
and suitable for transition. A meeting with Mr. [Patrick Masson](@massonpj@fosstodon.org), Executive Director of the Apereo Foundation,
indicated potential interest. Subsequently, we received a questionnaire
from the Apero Foundation for the Dat Ecosystem to complete,
along with an invitation to pose any inquiries of relevance.

### Proposal Details

In accordance with the aforementioned findings and discussions,
the Dat Ecosystem proposes to transition its fiscal sponsorship to the Apero Foundation.

#### Key Actions Proposed:
1. Completion of the [Questionnaire](./questionaire.pdf) provided by the Apero Foundation for Consortium Member Review.
2. Submission of Proposed [Answers](./answers.md) to the Apero Foundation.
3. Fulfillment of additional conditions stipulated by the Apero Foundation, including:
   * Quarterly filing of the specified [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTMOgmpixxvZ31DCxLVjFXY1UT_HQFwOurGmsdz0IAJoI_Ag/viewform).
   * Acceptance of the [Apero Foundation's welcome policy](https://www.apereo.org/about/governance/welcoming-policy-20).

### Proposal Outcome

### Approval Process
