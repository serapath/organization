**USAGE INTENTION:**
The following is what we ideally would want:
1. All email addresses would just permanently forward to hi@dat-ecosystem.org
2. We would be happy if all emails sent and received by any of the old email addresses could be copied or forwarded once to hi@dat-ecosystem.org
3. We want to cause as little work as possible. The main domain these days is https://dat-ecosystem.org and old pages are kept, because a lot of links exist that point to them and that is why we want to add the deprecation notice to all domains we haven't yet. We do have github repositories and github pages for all old dat related websites, but as you noticed, some of them are currently not active sadly (such as dat-data.com) and we plan to restore them showing the original website and the deprecation notice to forward to the dat-ecosystem.org website.
4. One domain missing from the list is `https://dat.land` and also `https://try-dat.com`, which have been used in the past, but I assume they expired. Too bad, but it is what it is i guess, but otherwise we'd be happy to re-activate them as well.
5. The https://dat-ecosystem.org domain is currently held on behalf of dat-ecosystem by the company behind the dat-ecosystem project "datdot". We did set up a zoho email account, because zoho provides a free custom domain email account and we could not find any other provider who does that. These days, dat-ecosystem consortium uses "discord app" to communicate and mirrors everything to an instance of the dat project "cabal chat" (a p2p chat system), so if discord ever has problems, we still have the cabal chat running with a copy of all messages and the ability to communicate through a dat powered p2p chat system.
6. One additional question we have is whether it would be a lot of effort to establish a mailing list. In the past few years we have been using a service hosted by https://riseup.net/ to manage our mailing list, but the sad part is the mail address ends in riseup.net and we would definitely be happier if we could create something like `news@dat-ecosystem.org` or `mailinglist@dat-ecosystem.org`. If this causes additional inconvenience though we can keep it the way it is.
